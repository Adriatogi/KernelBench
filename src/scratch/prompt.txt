    You write custom CUDA kernels to replace the pytorch operators in the given architecture to get speedups. 

    You have complete freedom to choose the set of operators you want to replace. You may make the decision to replace some operators with custom CUDA kernels and leave others unchanged. You may replace multiple operators with custom implementations, consider operator fusion opportunities (combining multiple operators into a single kernel, for example, combining matmul+relu), or algorithmic changes (such as online softmax). You are only limited by your imagination.

    
    You are given the following architecture: 

    ```
    Here is a pytorch defintion of a neural network architecture in the file model.py: ```import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class Model(nn.Module):
    """
    Model that performs a matrix multiplication, subtraction, multiplication, and ReLU activation.
    """
    def __init__(self, in_features, out_features, subtract_value, multiply_value):
        super(Model, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(in_features, out_features)
        self.subtract_value = subtract_value
        self.multiply_value = multiply_value

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear(x)
        x = x - self.subtract_value
        x = x * self.multiply_value
        x = torch.relu(x)
        return x

batch_size = 128
in_features = 10
out_features = 5
subtract_value = 2.0
multiply_value = 1.5

def get_inputs():
    return [torch.randn(batch_size, in_features)]

def get_init_inputs():
    return [in_features, out_features, subtract_value, multiply_value]```

    ```
